\begin{abstract}
The muon g­-2 experiment at Fermi lab looks to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon to an
unprecedented precision of 0.14 ppm to verify results from the E821 experiment at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. In addition to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon the project also seeks to measure
the muon electric dipole moment to a better precision than has previously has been achieved.
These measurement along with standard model predictions may result in a discrepancy between the
standard model and experimental results which may give some insight to beyond standard model physics.

For this thesis I will present the results for systematics studies from the straw tube trackers in this
experiment mainly the resolution and cross talk in the detectors. I will also present how
this will vary with a few of the final measurements for this experiment.

\begin{acknowledgments}
  I would like to thank my advisor Micheal Eads for his financial support, and guidance in completing this research. He has been extremely patient and kind with me while completing the research for this thesis which allowed me to gather a great deal of knowledge that I otherwise would have never been able to do elsewhere.
  
  
  I would like to thank my committee members, Mike Syphers, and David Hedin. During our meeting they have given me there valuable insight which helped give me direction for my research.
  
  
  I would also like to thank all of the professors in the department for giving me the opportunity to study at NIU and giving me direction throughout the course of graduate school.
