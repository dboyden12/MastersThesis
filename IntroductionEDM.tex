\chapter{Introduction to the Muon EDM Measurement}
The muon EDM measurement is a very important measurement in the field of physics. It currently be shown that the muon does not have an up to the limit of ??. According the the standard model the muon should have an EDM to the ?? level. However, if there is a greater EDM this could be proof for physics that is beyond the standard model. In this chapter it covers different techniques of the EDM measurement in the current gm2 experiment. This will help explain why we are interested in different systematical uncertainties.
